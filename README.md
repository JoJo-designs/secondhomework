For my portfolio website I am using a simple scrolling site. I made an image responsive. The images in grid each will be a link to a project that is live on the internet.

Code
    The majority of the code is my own but I used an a css reset I found online. I started by having an idea of the layout I wanted. I decided on a hero image with a nav bar that is fixed to the top of the page. Under the hero image is a image grid that is three columns wide. originally I didn't have any margins between the images but I changed my mind later on. Under the grid is the about me section and the footer.
    
    Most elements are flex but the about me section and footer are done with mostly with media queries. The header is not responsive because having the elements on top of the other and the header being fixed to the top of the page would make it harder to see the content on smaller screens. 

    The hardest part if this project was trying to make it responsive. The about me section was the worst of all the sections. The text was being pushed by the image a lot I needed to create a break point earlier than normal and it was a little effort to find just the right point that make it look nice. In the media queries I made the text and image in the about me section would be a single column.

Design 
    When I was creating a layout for my website I wanted to make it functional and appealing to the eye. The site has a 3 column grid on desktop and two on smaller screen sizes and used the branding I am already using as a graphic designer. Originally I only had an image grid but the featured Project was added later. I like the way the one project is bigger and helps create some separation between sections. 

    At the moment most of the copy is just filler I will replace it with real text before I start looking for jobs.
