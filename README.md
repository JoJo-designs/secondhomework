For my portfoilo website I am using a simple scrolling site. I made an image reponsive. The images in grid each will be a link to a project that is live on the internet. 

Done
    Make navigation work
    Build a contact form and more contact info? 
    Put a tags around the images in the image grid
    make it responsive.
    Appropriate filler images in project grid.
    Added a hero image at the top of the page.
    About me section 
    Change the colours so they look nice together

Code
    The majority of the code is my own but I used an a css reset I found online. I started by having an idea of the layout I wanted. I desided on a hero image with a nav bar that is fixed to the top of the page. Under the hero image is a image grid that is three coloums wide. orginaly I didn't have any margins between the images but I chageed my mind later on. Under the grid is the about me section and the footer.
    
    Most elements are flex but the about me section and footer are done with mostly with media quries. The header is not reponsive because having the elements on top of the other and the header being fixed to the top of the page would make it harder to see the content on smaller screens. 

    The hardest part if this porject was trying to make it responsive. The about me section was the worst of all the sections. The text was being pushed by the image alot I needed to create a break point earlier than normal and it was a little effort to find just the right point that make it look nice. In the media quries I made the text and image in the about me section would be a single coloum.

Design 
    When I was creating a layout for my website I wanted to make it functional and appealing to the eye. The site has a 3 coloum grid on desktop and two on smaller screen sizes and usesd the branding I am already useing as a graphic designer. Orginally I only had an image grid but the featured Project was added later. I like the way the one project is bigger and helps create some seperation beteen sections. 

    At the moment most of the copy is just filler I will replace it with real text before I start looking for jobs.
